# VEEAM
VEEAM scripts and snippets I've created or mashed together

- Onboard-RestoreOperators.ps1: An adaption of the VEEAM "Connect-VBRRestorePortal.ps1" script, reworked to allow delegated Microsoft 365 partners to setup the Restore Portal application and the restore operators security group both invidually and in bulk. It will also setup the Restore Operators in VBO if run on the VBO server.
